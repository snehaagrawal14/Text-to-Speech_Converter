# Text-to-Speech Converter

This Python project uses the **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** library to convert text into speech. The script takes user input as text, generates a speech audio file, and plays it.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Takes user input as text.
- **Speech Generation**: Converts the input text into speech using gTTS.
- **Audio Output**: Saves the speech as an MP3 file and optionally plays it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `gTTS` library
- `IPython` (for playing the audio in Jupyter Notebooks)

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install gTTS
pip install IPython
